EIGHTY STORIES above the eacophonous terra firma of the xenophobiceity, the intractable equilibrist.
without valediction, stepped out for a feat of postprandial funambulism on the wire that stretched between
the buildings. He gazed at the unsightly chips in the bas-relief frieze of
the opposite monolithic tower, a superannuated skyscraper of stone and translucent plastic; some malefic miscreant had fired egregiously at the
building with a hand weapon, damaging the sculpture, but the sacrosanct
Punctilios of the city’s'patronizing and supercilious elite had prevented
more than a token punishment of the egocentric youth.

‘The equilibrist, in a stoical but discursive soliloquy, had abjured’
“analgesics, and now his head began to pulse fortissimo with the magnitude
of the challenge that had become his idée fixe, a nonpareil: to cross the
wire to the farthest building. It would be his magnumopus. He would
be lionized as the metempsychosis of Houdini. Hagiographies would be
written in his honor, for this distance was nojinterstice, and the buildings
were by no means contiguous. In supercilious sangfroid, he stood over
the man-made abyss.

Far below, the mellifluous, sotto voce hum of the traffic— exiting
the city in confluent streams of red tail lights—signaled that the city had
not yet settled into sedate night. Far above, the omniscient physiognomyy
of the constellations twinkled its (imiponderable ‘benediction on = a

‘equilibrist as he stepped, with thelimeredulous joy of a NeOphyte

on the wire.
